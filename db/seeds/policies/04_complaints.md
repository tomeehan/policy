**POLICY STATEMENT**

Acme Care Services welcomes feedback, including complaints, as an opportunity to learn and improve our services. We are committed to handling all complaints fairly, promptly, and confidentially.

**OUR COMMITMENT**

We will:

- Take all complaints seriously
- Respond to complaints promptly and courteously
- Investigate complaints thoroughly and impartially
- Keep complainants informed throughout the process
- Learn from complaints to improve our services
- Treat complainants fairly and without prejudice

### How to Make a Complaint

Complaints can be made:

a) In person to any member of staff

b) By telephone to our office

c) In writing by letter or email

d) Through an advocate or representative

### Complaints Procedure

**Stage 1 - Local Resolution**

We aim to resolve complaints informally and locally wherever possible. The manager will acknowledge receipt within 3 working days and aim to resolve the matter within 10 working days.

**Stage 2 - Formal Investigation**

If the complainant is not satisfied with the Stage 1 response, they may request a formal investigation. A senior manager will investigate and respond within 20 working days.

**Stage 3 - External Review**

If the complainant remains dissatisfied, they may escalate the complaint to:

- The Local Government and Social Care Ombudsman
- The Care Quality Commission
- The relevant local authority commissioning team

### Recording and Monitoring

All complaints will be recorded and monitored to identify trends and areas for improvement. Complaint data will be reviewed quarterly by senior management.

### Confidentiality

Complaints will be handled confidentially. Information will only be shared with those who need to know in order to investigate and resolve the complaint.

### Support for Complainants

We recognise that making a complaint can be difficult. We can provide information about independent advocacy services and will ensure complainants are not disadvantaged as a result of raising concerns.
