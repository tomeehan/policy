**POLICY STATEMENT**

Acme Care Services encourages a culture of openness where staff feel confident to raise concerns about wrongdoing without fear of reprisal. This policy provides a framework for reporting concerns and the protections available to those who speak up.

**SCOPE**

This policy applies to all employees, workers, agency staff, volunteers and contractors. It covers concerns about:

- Criminal offences
- Failure to comply with legal obligations
- Miscarriages of justice
- Danger to health and safety
- Damage to the environment
- Deliberate concealment of any of the above

### Protection for Whistleblowers

Staff who raise genuine concerns in good faith will be protected from:

- Dismissal
- Disciplinary action
- Victimisation or harassment
- Detriment in their employment

The Public Interest Disclosure Act 1998 provides legal protection for workers who raise concerns about wrongdoing.

### How to Raise a Concern

**Internal Reporting**

Concerns should normally be raised with:

a) Your line manager in the first instance

b) A senior manager if your line manager is involved

c) The Registered Manager or Director

Concerns can be raised verbally or in writing. Anonymous reports will be considered but may be more difficult to investigate.

**External Reporting**

If internal reporting is not appropriate or has not resolved the matter, concerns may be raised with:

- The Care Quality Commission
- The Local Authority safeguarding team
- The Health and Safety Executive
- The Police (for criminal matters)

### Investigation

All concerns will be investigated promptly and thoroughly. The whistleblower will be informed of the outcome where appropriate.

### False Allegations

Malicious or vexatious allegations may result in disciplinary action. However, no action will be taken against staff who raise concerns in good faith, even if the concern is not substantiated.

### Confidentiality

We will protect the identity of whistleblowers as far as possible, though this cannot be guaranteed in all circumstances.
